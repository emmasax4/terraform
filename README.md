# terraform

Terraform modules for GitHub and GitLab projects, repositories, labels, branches, etc. See the examples for more information on how to use these.

The modules here were `git filter-branch`ed from private projects where I previously stored both the terraform modules _and_ where I called the modules. Now, I'm breaking that out, so the modules are public, and where I call the modules are private. That's why some of the commit messages may look a bit funky.
